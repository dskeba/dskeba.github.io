        <p><strong>Early Programming Beginnings</strong></p>
<p>I started programming at a very young age by making websites for my hobbies. When I turned 12, my dad got me a copy of Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0. I was able to start making basic desktop applications. Ever since my first desktop application, I knew I wanted to become a programmer. The ability to create felt so freeing and is one of the aspects of  programming that has made it such a special hobby and career choice.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Expansion</strong></p>
<p>I began exploring harder to learn programming languages and technologies such as C++, DirectX and OpenGL. My early focus was game development. Learning how to create rigorous  games in 2D and 3D taught me a lot about persistence and how to see a project through to the end. Add to the fact that when I first started learning, the easy-to-use engines that exist today such as Unreal and Unity, were few and far between. I ended up having to take the harder approach, writing my 3d code in just plain C++ and DirectX/OpenGL.</p>
<p><strong>Web Development</strong></p>
<p>Through my development and coding experience, I realized the power of the web and just how many applications and platforms were being built right on top of it. Through web exploration, I realized it was faster and easier to turn my web apps into product. Rather than creating desktop applications or games,I started learning backend technologies such as PHP. This allowed the creation of complicated websites and services. To further add to those skills, and to market my skills, I also spent time learning the fundamentals of SEO and internet marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Web Technology</strong></p>
<p>As I entered college, some of my websites were beginning to get a lot of traffic and the age of advertising had been booming. During these years, I was extensively focused on creating many content based websites and services. Some using CMS technologies such as Wordpress and others rolling my own frameworks, such as Swift PHP. I was able to employ myself full time with the money I had made from placing advertisements on these websites. It is also during this time, that front-end web development had really started becoming more than just HTML/CSS and full fledged JavaScript frameworks started becoming the new normal.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Projects</strong></p>
<p>After I graduated from GVSU with a Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree in Computer Science, I continued my web development business and websites, but wanted to pursue more. I was able to join a young start-up company called Adaptive Projections. There, I was able to work on some really fun and interactive projects, such as custom curved displays that used software to map multiple projectors to form a single screen. Also we created software using cameras and projectors to allow digital objects to follow and interact with people walking by. Ultimately, although the technologies being developed were extremely fun, we were not able to become very profitable and I had decided to move on to a more traditional programming job.</p>
<p><strong>USF Holland</strong></p>
<p>This is when I started working for Holland Inc. Holland is a very large trucking company in the midwest USA and although their main focus was not on software, it required them to have a very reliable and robust freight management system across their network. I was able to create new functions in their system and improve others. Although this time was rewarding, I felt that with my experience and motivation I wanted to get into more cutting edge software development.</p>
<p><strong>Entrepreneurship</strong></p>
<p>I then decided to continue working on my own again. I continued my web development company, Media Vim LLC, and started some new ventures. One of these was Crawler Builder. Crawler Builder was a web scraping platform where users could sign up and pay per crawl. I created a vast set of front-end tools so that even inexperienced users could create their own custom web spiders that could extract information from sets of web pages, such as pricing information on amazon, housing information from property websites, public records and more. This was a very fun and ambitious project. I was able to use my own PHP framework I had developed years prior and focus and ease of use for the front-end website. This was probably the first web app that required a decent amount of architecture, because it was a combination of front-end HTML/CSS/Javascript, backend PHP/MySQL for the web, and also Python/Scrapy for the web crawlers that were run on their own servers.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t slow down there and I also created another SaaS application called CostBrain. My brother had recently received a grant to research pain points for restaurant owners and was able to interview 50 different establishments. He had some good ideas on creating an app for managing invoices, analyzing food costs, and helping restaurant owners make more money on their menu items. He just needed an experienced web developer that could help create the whole system. Of course, being excited to create something new and apply all I had learned up to this point, I felt I was a perfect fit and jumped on board. We spent about one year developing our platform and had over 6,000 restaurants sign up! This was especially rewarding and challenging as well, because there was a lot more interaction and managing customers that I had with previous projects. It was very eye opening to learn that the software we developers create is not always for &ldquo;us&rdquo; and creating a useful and intuitive experiecne for the customer often diverges from what a programmer may want. After the feature requirements for this platform began to slow down, I was eager again to learn more and push my skill level again.</p>
<p><strong>KPMG Development</strong></p>
<p>I started slowly applying for jobs that I thought would offer a more cutting edge software development process. I had become relatively greedy in my searching and turned down many offers because I truly wanted to work with a company or team that was focused on qualtiy software and modern technologies. Eventually I had found a position with KPMG US. This was initially a contract position but was very exciting because the team was working with micro services around AI/Machine Learning technologies but also in an agile environment. After only 6 months contracting with them, I was offered a full-time position as a Senior Developer. Since then I have been able to continue my practive of working on both front-end and backend technologies and even recently, have begun developing within cloud and kubernetes. I continue to work at KPMG US today and am excited for what the future brings as far as learning new lessons and technologies. Programming is truly a rewarding practice that can allow one to work within many industries and fuel creative passions which keep it exciting and fresh everyday.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read about me and my journey in programming.</p>
